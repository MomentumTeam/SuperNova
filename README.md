# SuperNova

To run with docker, just run:

docker-compose up

1. You can put in comment *-script, kafka and elastic related images.
2. It is better if you run "docker-compose up -d mongo redis" before running the rest.
3. Verify that supernova.env is good for your environment.
4. When running any service on ubuntu, run "npm start", on windows, run "npm run start_windows".
5. For any enum A generated by protoc, there exist two methods: aToJSON (get string from enum value) and aFromJSON (get enum value from string). 
6. In order to run SuperNovaUI as a container, just run "git clone https://github.com/MomentumTeam/SuperNovaUI.git" (checkout to develop) in the main folder before.
7. If you get EACCES error related to a container trying to write logs (when using ./logs as volume), just run "sudo chmod -R a+rw ./logs".
8. In order to generate typescript interfaces by the proto files, run the fllowing commands:  "cd proto-builder && npm i" and "./loadProto.sh".
